Coding Challenge 


     
Develop an iPhone-App in Swift for searching and showing music album information provided by the LastFM-API (  https://www.last.fm/de , similiar alternative APIs would be ok).

The app should contain the following screens:

main-screen: This screen shows all the albums found by searching after an artist name, presented in a UICollectionView. A tap on one of these albums opens a detail - page.  The navigationBar contains a search-icon, which opens the search on tap.

Detail Page : Overview with detailed information (name, artist, tracks, etc.) about the album.

Requirements:

- Swift-Version > 4

- >= iOS 10

- API communication in JSON-format

- Use the Codable protocol to serialize the JSON

Optional:

UI and UX is fully up to you. Animations and gestures are not required, but nice to have.

Use the following :
 API key 16f77b0b415193c7754be7a7896ca057
Shared secret 730abfc1ea6c06c21b93fb0007b28a3b

Feel free to be creative  :) 

Good luck!
